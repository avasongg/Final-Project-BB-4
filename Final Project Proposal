Climate change is a pressing global issue that impacts various aspects of human and environmental systems. This project focuses on examining the relationship between climate variables, such as temperature and precipitation, and their interaction with urban development, demographic changes, and historical patterns. Research in this area is extensive, spanning various disciplines including environmental science, urban studies, and public policy.

One significant piece of research is from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), which regularly publishes comprehensive reports on climate trends. Their studies often utilize historical climate data similar to what we intend to use, providing a strong foundation for understanding long-term climate variations and their impacts on urban areas.

Another relevant study is conducted by researchers at Columbia University's Earth Institute, which explored the effects of urbanization on regional climates. Their work, which integrates historical weather data with urban development statistics, found significant correlations between increased urbanization and changes in local weather patterns, particularly temperature and precipitation rates (Zhou et al., 2019).

Additionally, the research paper "Urban Climate Change," published in the Journal of Climate, delves into how urban landscapes influence local climates. This study uses data from multiple cities to analyze temperature and precipitation trends over decades, offering insights into the effects of urban growth and density on climate variables (Smith et al., 2018).

These studies collectively highlight the complexities of climate change and its multifaceted impacts on urban environments. They underscore the importance of historical data in understanding these dynamics and inform policies aimed at mitigating adverse effects on urban populations.

## 5. Challenges & Limitations  
Conducting a project on the topic of how the climate can change based on its interactions with different factors such as urban development, demographic changes, and historical patterns is very complex. For example, we must take into account how a factor like urbanization can create microclimates from densely populated downtown buildings, which results in creating more heat than perhaps a more suburban area. Since urbanization may contribute to an increase in temperature, it can further influence the behavior of other aspects such as population, precipitation, and other socioeconomic and environmental factors. This brings about the challenge of determining causal relationships: extreme heat can cause changes in the climate, but changes in climate can cause a shift in population and migration as well. 
In our project, unraveling these causal relationships is crucial for understanding the dynamics of climate change and its other factors, since there are many complexities as to why and how the climate changes.
